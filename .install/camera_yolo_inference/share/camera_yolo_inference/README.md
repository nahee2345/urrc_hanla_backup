# camera_yolo_inference

This is the official D456 RGB YOLO-Seg inference package. The independent
`race_perception/yolo_camera_node.py` implementation is legacy and is not
included by this package's launch files.

## Perception-only validation

```bash
ros2 launch camera_yolo_inference d456_yolo_perception.launch.py
```

The default profile starts exactly one D456 process and the inference node on
`cuda:0`. CUDA is required and there is no automatic CPU fallback. Optional
depth helpers and RQT are disabled by default. Start RQT with
`launch_rqt:=true`, or start the camera separately and use
`launch_camera:=false`.

Main validation output: `/perception/detections_image`.

The node also publishes all 12 semantic masks under `/perception/masks/*`, the
three compatibility masks under `/camera/*_mask`, detections JSON, inference
latency/status, `/camera/perception_valid`, and the distinct
`/camera/navigation_mask_available` signal.

## TensorRT deployment profile

The NVIDIA production profile defaults to the static, batch-one, 640-pixel
FP16 TensorRT engine in `models/`. INT8, dynamic shapes, CPU fallback, and
automatic `.pt` fallback are disabled. The engine is an RTX 5060 deployment
artifact and should be rebuilt for a materially different GPU/runtime.

Create an engine explicitly (never during ROS node startup):

```bash
python3 tools/export_tensorrt_engine.py \
  --model models/hanla_yolo11n_seg_best.pt \
  --output models/hanla_yolo11n_seg_best.engine
```

The adjacent `.engine.json` records the source hash, toolchain, GPU, profile,
classes, and creation time. Compare backends and collect pure-backend latency:

```bash
python3 tools/benchmark_backends.py --help
```

`/camera/inference_latency_ms` is the model backend's reported inference stage
only; it excludes image conversion, decode, semantic-mask processing,
rendering, JSON, and ROS publication. `/camera/pipeline_latency_ms` is the full
per-frame pipeline wall time. `/camera/performance_diagnostics` publishes a
periodic JSON summary with bounded-window stage statistics, observed processing
FPS, and overwritten latest-frame count.

The node keeps the real-camera input default at sensor-data BEST_EFFORT QoS.
Saved-video benchmarks may set `input_reliability:=reliable` together with a
RELIABLE publisher to avoid local DDS fragmentation loss; publisher and
subscriber reliability must be changed as a pair.

Road, white-line, and yellow-line masks are always generated and published on
both their semantic and compatibility topics. Other full-resolution semantic
mask messages are subscriber-aware by default and are serialized only while a
subscriber exists; set `publish_optional_masks:=true` to force all 12 topics.
All topic names and message types remain available.
