# Arduino serial protocol

The ROS bridge uses 115200 baud and newline-terminated ASCII frames.

## Arduino to ROS (already verified)

```text
T,<encoder_count>,<rpm>,<steering_angle_deg>\n
```

The installed Korean v14 firmware emits the same values on demand rather than
periodically. The bridge sends the non-actuating `S` query at 10 Hz and parses:

```text
[상태] A0=359 편차=-4 누적=0/440 RPM=0.0 오도=0 PWM=0
```

Example:

```text
T,1234,56.7,-12.5
```

## ROS to Arduino (existing v14 firmware)

ROS uses signed stages `-3..3`. The bridge maps them to the firmware lines:

```text
0  -> 1.00 (stop)
+1 -> 2.00 (forward 1)
+2 -> 3.00 (forward 2)
+3 -> 4.00 (forward 3)
-1 -> 6.00 (reverse 1)
-2 -> 7.00 (reverse 2)
-3 -> 8.00 (reverse 3)
```

Nonzero Lookahead steering degrees are converted to the proportional command
`V,-1.0..1.0`. For a configured maximum of 27 degrees, `13.5 deg` becomes
`V,0.500`. An exact `0 deg` Lookahead target sends `C`, returning the
firmware's accumulated steering position to logical zero. This does not use
the A0 neutral reference.

Current measured/assumed vehicle geometry:

```text
wheelbase: 0.73 m
wheel diameter: 0.26 m (radius 0.13 m)
maximum steering: +/-27 deg
L1/R1 steering: approximately -/+9 deg until detailed angle calibration
forward stage 3 (PWM 100): 2.98 km/h = 0.82778 m/s
linear command calibration: 3.62416 stage/(m/s)
```

`Z` stores the manually aligned steering zero. It is intentionally not sent
automatically by ROS because an incorrect wheel position would store a bad
zero.

The third `T` telemetry field is accumulated steering motor drive time in
milliseconds, with a documented maximum of about `+/-440 ms`; it is not a
measured angle. The bridge publishes the raw value on `/steer_position_ms` and
a linear estimate on `/steer_angle`, using `+/-440 ms == +/-27 deg`. The angle
must therefore be treated as an estimate until physically calibrated.

The physically aligned straight-ahead position measured on 2026-08-07 is
`A0=371`. This value is diagnostic only and is not used to generate steering
commands. The bridge stores it as `steering_neutral_a0` and publishes the raw
sensor reading on `/steer_a0`, its signed difference from neutral on
`/steer_a0_error`, and the tolerance check on `/steer_at_neutral`. This A0
reference is the authoritative physical neutral; the firmware's accumulated
motor time is not a measured steering center.

The ROS side also starts locked. Transmission requires all of the following:

1. `allow_transmit: true` in `arduino_bridge.yaml`.
2. `maximum_abs_stage` set within the verified range `1..3`.
3. Fresh Arduino telemetry and fresh `/camera_drive` (Float32 stage),
   `/camera_wheel` (Int32 degrees) messages.
4. A successful `/arduino_bridge/set_tx_enabled` service call.

The existing v14 firmware has a 2-second communication watchdog. The bridge
repeats the active drive command every 0.5 seconds. If ROS commands or feedback
go stale, the bridge sends `1.00` and `C`, then disarms. If the bridge
crashes or USB disconnects, the firmware watchdog stops the drive within about
2 seconds. The manual describes this as an automatic deceleration stop, not an
instant brake; the physical E-Stop remains the emergency stop.

Do the first transmission test with the drive wheels lifted from the ground,
using forward stage 1 only.
